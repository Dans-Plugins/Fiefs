# Fiefs User Guide

## What is Fiefs?

Fiefs is a Spigot plugin that adds a sub-faction territory system to Medieval Factions servers. Faction members can create fiefs — named sub-groups within their faction — and claim chunks of faction land for those fiefs.

## Requirements

- [Medieval Factions](https://github.com/Dans-Plugins/Medieval-Factions) must be installed.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `Fiefs-<version>.jar` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Dans-Plugins/Fiefs/releases) page.
2. Place the JAR (and the Medieval Factions JAR) in your server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Restart the server.

## Getting Started

1. Create a fief within your faction: `/fi create "Fief Name"`
2. Invite members: `/fi invite <player>`
3. Claim faction land for your fief: stand in a faction-owned chunk and run `/fi claim`
4. Check fief ownership of a chunk: `/fi checkclaim`
5. View all fiefs in your faction: `/fi list`

## Who Can Do What

- Inviting players, kicking members, setting flags, renaming, transferring and disbanding a fief are for its owner only; another member is told so.
- Any member of a fief can claim faction land for it, unclaim its land and change its description. Claiming needs land the faction has claimed that no fief holds yet; unclaiming works only on land the player's own fief holds.
- A player in no fief cannot claim or unclaim land for a fief.
- Faction land that no fief has claimed is governed by Medieval Factions alone: every member of the faction can use it, whatever their fief.

## Fief Flags

A fief's owner views and changes its flags with `/fi flags show` and `/fi flags set <flag> <value>`.

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `claimedLandProtected` | `true` | When `true`, only members of the fief can build, break blocks, open containers and doors, and use item frames and armour stands in the land the fief has claimed; other members of the faction, in another fief or in none, are refused. When `false`, the fief's land is open to every member of the faction (Medieval Factions' own protection still keeps other factions out). Only the flag of the fief that holds the land counts. |
